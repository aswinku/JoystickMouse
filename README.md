# JoystickMouse
For our final university project, I created a device for a person with a hereditary disorder that prevents him from doing simple tasks such as moving a mouse. 
This device uses a joystick and is ergonomic so it can be used instead of a mouse to move the cursor. It also uses LDRs to control mouse clicking.
I programmed this device using an Arduino Micro so that I can use a library that allows the cursor to be controlled by the joystick and LDRs.
